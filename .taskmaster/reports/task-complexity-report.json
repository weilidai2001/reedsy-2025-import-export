		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure' task into subtasks covering: 1) Directory structure creation, 2) Package.json configuration for all services, 3) TypeScript configuration, and 4) Git repository initialization with .gitignore",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the foundational structure but is relatively straightforward. It requires creating directories, configuring package.json files, setting up TypeScript, and initializing git. These are discrete steps that can be handled independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Shared Types",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Shared Types' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the types.ts file with all required type definitions, and 2) Setting up module exports and testing imports from other services",
			"reasoning": "This is a low complexity task with well-defined type definitions already provided. The main work is creating the types file and ensuring it can be properly imported by other services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TaskRegistry Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement TaskRegistry Service' task into subtasks covering: 1) Express app setup, 2) SQLite database setup with WAL mode, 3) Jobs table schema and CRUD operations, 4) API endpoint implementation, and 5) Swagger documentation",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a database, implementing CRUD operations, and creating multiple API endpoints. It requires careful implementation of the persistence layer which is critical for the system's functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scheduler Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Scheduler Service' task into subtasks covering: 1) Express app setup, 2) In-memory queue implementation for different job types, 3) Queue management operations (enqueue/dequeue), and 4) Job dispatching to Handler services",
			"reasoning": "The Scheduler service requires implementing in-memory queues and job dispatching logic. It's moderately complex due to the need to manage different queue types and ensure proper job routing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Handler Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Handler Service' task into subtasks covering: 1) Service setup, 2) Job polling/subscription mechanism, 3) Job processing with simulated delays, and 4) Error handling and retry logic",
			"reasoning": "The Handler service involves asynchronous processing, communication with other services, and error handling. The complexity comes from managing job state transitions and implementing proper error recovery."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Receptionist Service",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Receptionist Service' task into subtasks covering: 1) Express app setup, 2) API endpoint implementation for exports and imports, 3) Request validation and job creation logic, and 4) Communication with TaskRegistry and Scheduler services",
			"reasoning": "The Receptionist service acts as the API gateway and requires implementing multiple endpoints with validation. It's moderately complex due to the need to coordinate with other services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Service Communication",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Service Communication' task into subtasks covering: 1) HTTP client implementation with retry logic, 2) Error handling and timeout configuration, and 3) Health check endpoints for each service",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on reliable inter-service communication. The complexity comes from implementing proper retry logic, error handling, and ensuring robust communication between services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Swagger Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Swagger Documentation' task into subtasks covering: 1) Swagger setup for TaskRegistry service, 2) Swagger setup for Scheduler service, 3) Swagger setup for Handler service, and 4) Swagger setup for Receptionist service",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating OpenAPI specifications for each service. While not technically complex, it requires detailed documentation of all endpoints across multiple services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Horizontal Scaling Support",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Horizontal Scaling Support' task into subtasks covering: 1) Making Receptionist service stateless, 2) Making Handler service stateless, 3) Implementing singleton pattern for Scheduler service, and 4) Implementing singleton pattern for TaskRegistry service",
			"reasoning": "This task involves architectural considerations for scalability. The complexity comes from ensuring services can scale appropriately while maintaining singleton behavior where needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Build and Deployment Scripts",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Build and Deployment Scripts' task into subtasks covering: 1) NPM scripts for building all services, 2) NPM scripts for starting all services, and 3) Docker configuration for containerized deployment",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating build and deployment configurations for multiple services. The complexity comes from coordinating builds across services and setting up Docker containerization."
