# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Shared Types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a shared types module that will be used across all services to ensure type consistency.
# Details:
Create a types.ts file in the shared directory with the following types as specified in the PRD:

```typescript
type JobDirection = "import" | "export";
type JobType = "epub" | "pdf" | "word" | "wattpad" | "evernote";
type JobState = "pending" | "processing" | "finished" | "failed";

type Job = {
  id: string;
  bookId: string;
  direction: JobDirection;
  type: JobType;
  state: JobState;
  sourceUrl?: string;
  resultUrl?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  startedAt?: string;
};
```

Ensure this module can be imported by all services.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify type definitions are correct and can be imported properly. Test with sample data to ensure type checking works as expected.
