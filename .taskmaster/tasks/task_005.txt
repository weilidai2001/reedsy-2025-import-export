# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Handler Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Handler service that will process jobs with simulated delays and update the TaskRegistry.
# Details:
Create a Node.js application for the Handler service. Implement long-polling or subscription mechanism to receive jobs from the Scheduler. Process jobs with simulated delays as specified in the PRD:
- epub: 10 seconds
- pdf (export): 25 seconds
- import (all types): 60 seconds

Implement job processing logic:
```javascript
async function processJob(job) {
  // Update job state to processing in TaskRegistry
  await updateJobState(job.id, 'processing');
  
  // Simulate processing delay based on job type
  const delay = getDelayForJobType(job.direction, job.type);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay * 1000));
  
  // Generate a result URL
  const resultUrl = `https://results.example.com/${job.id}.${job.type}`;
  
  // Update job as finished in TaskRegistry
  await updateJobResult(job.id, 'finished', resultUrl);
}
```

Implement error handling and retries for failed jobs.

# Test Strategy:
Test job processing with various job types. Verify correct delays are applied. Test error handling and recovery. Verify TaskRegistry updates are made correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Handler Service structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure for the Handler Service including project setup, configuration, and core interfaces
### Details:
1. Create a new directory 'handler-service' with proper TypeScript configuration
2. Set up package.json with required dependencies (express, axios, etc.)
3. Define interfaces for Job, JobStatus, and other core types
4. Implement configuration loading for environment variables
5. Create basic service structure with health check endpoint
6. Set up logging infrastructure

## 2. Implement job polling and subscription mechanism [pending]
