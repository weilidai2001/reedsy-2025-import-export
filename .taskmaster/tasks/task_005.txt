# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Handler Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Handler service that will process jobs with simulated delays and update the LogBook.
# Details:
Create a Node.js application for the Handler service. Implement long-polling or subscription mechanism to receive jobs from the Scheduler. Process jobs with simulated delays as specified in the PRD:
- epub: 10 seconds
- pdf (export): 25 seconds
- import (all types): 60 seconds

Implement job processing logic:
```javascript
async function processJob(job) {
  // Update job state to processing in LogBook
  await updateJobState(job.id, 'processing');
  
  // Simulate processing delay based on job type
  const delay = getDelayForJobType(job.direction, job.type);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay * 1000));
  
  // Generate a result URL
  const resultUrl = `https://results.example.com/${job.id}.${job.type}`;
  
  // Update job as finished in LogBook
  await updateJobResult(job.id, 'finished', resultUrl);
}
```

Implement error handling and retries for failed jobs.

# Test Strategy:
Test job processing with various job types. Verify correct delays are applied. Test error handling and recovery. Verify LogBook updates are made correctly.
